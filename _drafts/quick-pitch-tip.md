Hey guys\! I had to share this\!&nbsp;

I was struggling with my pitches for a bit\! I kept emailing a cold pitch and trying to get them to work with me right away. It became 50/50 that someone would respond because lets face it, brands are overwhelmed. Well I found this cute little trick in some groups that I really think could be helpful\!

I tested it yesterday\! I cold pitched 2 hotels and Death Valley, THEY RESPONDED\!

Ready for it...

I don't think you are...

That's it. And I got a response from both. Try it out\! Let me know how it goes\!&nbsp;
