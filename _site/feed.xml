Most day’s I hate it because of its always a competition. I often feel bad about myself if a photo doesn’t do good or if my likes suck. It’s also a numbers game. If you don’t have the followers you aren’t worthwhile. We have become so reliant on our self worth being based on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t about that, well in a way it is. Followers do count on Instagram and since it has become so saturated it is harder and harder to grow. But I am asking you to stop the follow/unfollow game! It hurts you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounts that do follow/unfollow are deemed unhealthy by Instagram when you look at your analytics. It actually hurts you when it helps you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, your followers can see you are following and unfollowing thousands of people. No one wants to see that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me! I’ve tested it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is a method that works with follow/unfollow but it is a bit different. I only suggest it with someone you trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/follow-unfollow-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/follow-unfollow-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My secret is creating a viral account! Yes, that is it. Create a Viral Account in your niche. Use that to leverage people to follow your own account. That’s how I grow at least 20-50 new follower a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you might be thinking  “ I don’t have time to grow a viral account!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry darlin I got you. I actually do this for a lower price than so many growth agencies out there. I already am growing a viral travel account as well as a second “alternate Brylee account” The Brylee account is almost at 1000 followers in less than a month and the viral Travel account is at 300 in a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you some are harder to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t just posting viral content you have to partner with hashtags that will help you grow or no one will see it. It’s a tricky process but worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in this process hit me up and I can help you. I promise its cheaper than those growth services that charge you to follow/unfollow on your own account. Also, I don’t need your password! &lt;br /&gt;Also better than buying likes or followers those are even worse, I’ll share more on those later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/follow-unfollow-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/follow-unfollow-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Social Media" /><summary type="html">Instagram Instagram Instagram I have a love/hate relationship with Instagram.

What does that mean? CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON! Cherry Blossoms are the staple of living in Japan. It’s the highlight of being there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also Japan’s busiest time of year. You cant even find hotels and flights jump up in prices. I swear Japan also increases prices on everything in their restaurants. They must have a special Cherry Blossom Season menu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/cherry-blossom-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/cherry-blossom-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Anyways there are some beautiful Places to see the cherry blossoms. Especially in Okinawa. Many people flock to mainland and Kyoto but Okinawa has its few small hidden gems. The best time to go is late January to early February but this can change so keep an eye out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Yaedake&lt;/strong&gt;- The drive up here is a long one but in the end, it’s worth it. The long winding roads of Cherry Blossoms are a site to see. Many people pull over and take photos so be aware. There are designated parking areas. So please don’t be that person who just pulls over wherever they please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nakijin Castle Ruins&lt;/strong&gt;- I was dumb and didn’t make it to this one but this is a great one I’ve read. This is also a UNESCO World Heritage site so you can kill 2 birds with one stone. From what I have read, at night the paths lined with small glass lanterns. Guess what?! Actually, they are used for the nighttime illumination. The scene you see at night sounds like a fairy tale!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nago Central Park&lt;/strong&gt;- Nago is the opposite end of Mout Yaedake so you cant make both in one day. This is the most recommended place in Okinawa. The festival time is great to go with all the local food vendors. I suggest the Yakisoba of course! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/cherry-blossom-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/cherry-blossom-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these are just 3 places to see Cherry Blossoms but Oki has so many! If you just drive outside of the city you can find them everywhere. Okinawa isn’t just beaches, there are mountains and waterfalls and so much more to see! Add it to your must-do list in Japan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/cherry-blossom-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/cherry-blossom-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Travel" /><summary type="html">It’s springtime!

Leaving Japan scared me. I had created such a small group of creators who loved to photograph together. When I came to Cali I was afraid I wouldn’t find that. But I decided to reach out to this amazing Photographer Isaiah E. KajumbaI. I saw his work and was absolutely amazed by his style of photography.! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of getting settled, he reached out to me and asked If I wanted to shoot with him and this local store in Downtown Ventura.. Goldies. OF COURSE, I DID! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t modeled in over a month! I was so excited and nervous but I did it. Take a look at some highlights. &lt;/p&gt;

That epic movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and the group of Travelers who live in Paradise? That movie is insane but that’s not the point. The point is, from that movie came the tourist destination in Thailand known as Maya Bay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maya bay is one of the most beautiful destinations in Thailand. The beach is enclosed by three 100 meter cliffs on each side. (no you don’t have to swim to get there). The area has silky white sand, colorful corals, and exceptionally clear aqua water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that’s what you read when you google “Maya Bay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the place is not as beautiful as described or as serene as the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/maya-bay-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/maya-bay-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all do to Tourism in Maya Bay. The tourist boom in the area has damaged the natural ecosystem of the area. Corals have been damaged by the insane amount of boats coming in and out of the area. The white sandy beaches have been littered by garbage tourists leave behind. And the clear aqua water is littered with long boats and speed carrying hoards of tourists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any given day, thousands of tourists come to Maya Bay. Therefore to get your famous “instagram worthy shot” you better be good at photoshopping. Or be an early riser who can get there before the crowds or after 5pm. But the problem is not many boats will go early or late so expect to be surrounded by loud music, loud people, no serenity or quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/maya-bay-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t get me wrong. The place is still worth a beautiful trip. When you go though, be delicate to the surrounding area and leave it as you found it. That means, TAKE YOUR TRASH. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to experience the full serenity and everything Maya Bay has to offer. I suggest doing Maya Bay Sleep Aboard. This once in a lifetime experience allows you to see the Bay without any footprints in the sand, no boats blocking your view, and hear the sound of the ocean, not over powered by the noise of people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/thailand-2017-2018-2088.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/maya-bay-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this tour, you get to actually sleep on a boat under the stars in the Bay. How cool is that?! At night you get to swim with the bioluminescent plankton. Something not many people can say they’ve done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** At the time of this article, Maya Bay is closed indefinitely to correct and restore the natural ecosystem. ** &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Travel" /><summary type="html">You’ve seen The Beach right?

If not I highly suggest you go. The cafes and restaurants are amazing and you can’t go wrong. I am always on the hunt for a new cafe, restaurant, or chill out place when I travel. Luckily in Bali, I found Alternative Beach! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alternative-beach-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;We first came here with the group from Institute of Code (more on that later) and I was blown away by all the suitable “instagram worthy” shots available. I swear, they designed this place in mind specifically for all you fabulous Instagrammers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alternative-beach-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the place is a hostel and a hotel all in one! Perfect for you budget travellers who love the hostel life, and crafted for the romantic lovers who want a private pool front villa. Creator thought of everything to appeal to the mass audiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t love a pool bar? I have no idea! Can’t think of a single person who’s had to complain and get out of the water to get their drink. Just swim on up order a cocktail, and sip it on one of the many floats they have available in the pool. Or chill out on the beachside walk in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alternative-beach-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alternative-beach-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to work on your Bali Bod? (I think that should be new hashtag on instagram) They have you covered. Wanderlust Fitness Studio. Yes That is the name of the gym on the premises. Sadly I was enjoying the outdoors to much to go inside, but I saw it through a window. Looked Fabulous. Time to get fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is short is sweet, when in Canggu head over to Alternative Beach for an evening of fun, drinks, laughter, and sweet content for your instagram that will last you weeks! &lt;/p&gt;
