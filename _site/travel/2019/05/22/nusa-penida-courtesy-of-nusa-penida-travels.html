<p>NUSA PENIDA!!! I had been dreaming of this place since I first saw it posted on Instagram. I dreamed of seeing the T-Rex beach as well as the Tree-Houses. So, when I decided I was going to do the Coding and Social Media Bootcamp with Institute of Code, I had to make time to go to Nusa Penida!</p>

<p>I read Nusa Penida can be very tricky and difficult to navigate on your own so I decided to do a tour with <a href="http://www.nusapenidatravels.com/" target="_blank">Nusa Penida Travels.</a></p>

<p>Seriously this made the trip 1000x easier than I think it could have. It was so simple, the tour group was friendly, and I couldn’t have asked for a better company to take my friends and I through <a href="http://www.nusapenidatravels.com/" target="_blank">Nusa Penida</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at where they took us!</p>

<p>Day 1: North and East Nusa Penida</p>

<p>Our day started with a pickup from our hotel at 6 am. Yeah super early but we were in Canguu so it was worth it. We had to get to the Sanur Harbor by 8 am and the company completely arranged our boat tickets for us! The boat ride was a bit choppy that day but so fun! All 3 of us were tired but we were ready for the day ahead!</p>

<p>We started at the Rumah Pohon treehouse.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-29.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>These Treehouses are incredible! There is actually a way to stay at them but be warned, Bali is HOT! They are on the side of the island with sunrise, so if you stay overnight, you will get the sunrise of a lifetime.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-38.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>While you’re already at the treehouses you get a view of Diamond Beach as well.</p>

<p>We then went to Atuh Beach.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-43.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>This was by far the highlight of the trip! The beach is so quiet, mostly locals with their shops, a few tourists. But the sand was white, and the water was so warm. We spent our day taking photos, having a cocktail and eating some local great food!</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-42.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>I think total we saw maybe 10 other tourists! I think many people skip this spot to for Diamond Beach.</p>

<p>Diamond Beach</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-36.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>Diamond beach is probably the second most popular photo you see on Instagram these days. The beach is flawless. You are able to climb the stairs down to the bottom, but it looked like a journey. I was so tired by this point; I couldn’t do it. I also found out, after I left there is a swing in the area! Must do for the next trip!</p>

<p>** please take note, this beach is not good for swimming due to strong currents and the coral in the area **</p>

<p>That was the end of day 1. We were so exhausted, already sunburned but having a blast!</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-20.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>When we booked with Nusa Penida Travels, they booked our hotel for us too. It was beautiful! There was a pool, a huge bathroom, and AC!</p>

<p>The tour company owner even came to meet us, take us to dinner and chat. We went to this beautiful little café by the beach, and had an amazing view of Mt. Agung.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-22.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nusapenidatravels.com/" target="_blank">Nusa Penida travels</a> not only books you a tour but, treats you like family!</p>

<p>Day 2: West Nusa</p>

<p>Kelingking View Point</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-56.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>FINALLY! The place I was waiting for. We had to go see the famous T-Rex beach. We wanted to beat the crowds so we were up at 6:15 to get to the spot. Best Decision ever. When we got there, only 2 other people were in sight! It was amazing!</p>

<p>We beat all the crowds because as soon as we left, the crowds came piling in!</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-3.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>There is a way to make it to the bottom, but you need to have comfortable shoes, and lots of time and water. We ran into some people who made the trek to the bottom, they were exhausted! If you do this, I suggest going right at sunrise or a bit before to avoid the heat.</p>

<p>Then onto Angels billabong</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-17.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>Let me start of by saying, I think this is the part where I thought we were going to die.  I could see us so close to the edge of the road I was so scared. The roads aren’t big enough for 2 cars but somehow, they make it work!</p>

<p>When we arrived, I was so thankful we had the best tour guide because he brought his drone! We managed to get some amazing drone shots! He even made sure we were safe getting into the water and took some awesome outtakes for us!</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-59.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>Make your way to Broken Beach</p>

<p>Broken beach is another stunning viewpoint. It was tranquil and peaceful to sit and just watch the water move. This would be palace for a picnic or just a place to sit with yourself and your thoughts.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-9.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>Snorkeling with manta rays!</p>

<p>Take note, this is all through the tour company which I highly suggest because, they go above and beyond to make sure you see the rays. They provided, water, towels and snacks for us on the boat!</p>

<p>This was the highlight everyone was waiting for! All we wanted was to see manta rays! Now everyone goes to Manta Point, but by the time we got there, it was crowded and overstuffed.</p>

<p>We managed to see a few through the cloudy water but they were so low we couldn’t get a great view. We left Manta point disappointed, but….</p>

<p>Then while on our way back, the boat drivers found a small group of mana rays and we got to spend an entire 30 minutes with them! They were so close you could touch them! * but don’t because it is illegal* Seriously the greatest gift seeing these big beautiful creatures. Some people aren’t lucky enough to find them, but we were.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-7.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>And that is that! Our trip with <a href="http://www.nusapenidatravels.com/" target="_blank">Nusa Penida travels</a> was once in a lifetime. If you plan to go to Nusa Penida, you have to make this company a priority. The roads of Nusa are so bad that if you rented a bike, you are likely to hurt yourself without experience in riding a motorbike.</p>

<p>The best part of this tour company, is they don’t come from the main island and create a tour company, they are locals who put in work and that you like family while you are with them. It is their way of making a living, by providing quality service at a great price.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nusa-penida-6.jpg" alt="Nusa-penida-tours" /></p>

<p>I can’t praise them enough for the care and quality they provided for us.</p>
