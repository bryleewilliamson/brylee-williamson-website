    <h2> Hey Ya'll...</h2>
    <p> my name is Brylee Williamson. I am a model, actress, content creator, blogger and web developer. My passion for modeling and traveling has grown throughout the past 6 years.

      I have a passion for learning other cultures and experiencing all the world has to offer, while creating a platform for others to experience as well. I create this through my writing and photography.

      Some of the many things I do include: blogging, web development, newsletter creation and automation. I build WordPress and Static websites and help you with your branding and business design. I also help with social media content creation,
      social media planning, and social media strategies.</p>

      My audience is fascinated by the content I create and thoroughly appreciate and engage on a regular basis.

      Since my blog started out as a way for me to show my friends and family what I had been up too, they had shared it with their friends and family and my audience has grown!

      I inspire my audience to capture experiences in life, whether its a digital nomad lifestyle, a casual traveler, or the 2 weeks a year vacation. </p>
