Instagram Instagram Instagram I have a love/hate relationship with Instagram. Most day’s I hate it because of its always a competition. I often feel bad about myself if a photo doesn’t do good or if my likes suck. It’s also a numbers game. If you don’t have the followers you aren't worthwhile. We have become so reliant on our self worth being based on Instagram.&nbsp;

But this isn't about that, well in a way it is. Followers do count on Instagram and since it has become so saturated it is harder and harder to grow. But I am asking you to stop the follow/unfollow game\! It hurts you\!&nbsp;

Accounts that do follow/unfollow are deemed unhealthy by Instagram when you look at your analytics. It actually hurts you when it helps you.&nbsp;

Also, your followers can see you are following and unfollowing thousands of people. No one wants to see that.&nbsp;

Trust me\! I’ve tested it.&nbsp;

So there is a method that works with follow/unfollow but it is a bit different. I only suggest it with someone you trust.&nbsp;

My secret is creating a viral account\! Yes, that is it. Create a Viral Account in your niche. Use that to leverage people to follow your own account. That's how I grow at least 20-50 new follower a day.&nbsp;

But you might be thinking &nbsp;“ I don’t have time to grow a viral account\!”

Don’t worry darlin I got you. I actually do this for a lower price than so many growth agencies out there. I already am growing a viral travel account as well as a second “alternate Brylee account” The Brylee account is almost at 1000 followers in less than a month and the viral Travel account is at 300 in a month.&nbsp;

Mind you some are harder to grow.

There isn't just posting viral content you have to partner with hashtags that will help you grow or no one will see it. It's a tricky process but worth it.&nbsp;

If you are interested in this process hit me up and I can help you. I promise its cheaper than those growth services that charge you to follow/unfollow on your own account. Also, I don't need your password\!&nbsp;<br>Also better than buying likes or followers those are even worse, I’ll share more on those later.&nbsp;<br>![](/uploads/follow-unfollow-3.jpg)
