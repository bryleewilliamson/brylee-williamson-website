It's springtime\! What does that mean? CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON\! Cherry Blossoms are the staple of living in Japan. It’s the highlight of being there.&nbsp;

It is also Japan’s busiest time of year. You cant even find hotels and flights jump up in prices. I swear Japan also increases prices on everything in their restaurants. They must have a special Cherry Blossom Season menu.&nbsp;

But Anyways there are some beautiful Places to see the cherry blossoms. Especially in Okinawa. Many people flock to mainland and Kyoto but Okinawa has its few small hidden gems. The best time to go is late January to early February but this can change so keep an eye out.&nbsp;

**Mount Yaedake**\- The drive up here is a long one but in the end, it's worth it. The long winding roads of Cherry Blossoms are a site to see. Many people pull over and take photos so be aware. There are designated parking areas. So please don’t be that person who just pulls over wherever they please.&nbsp;

<br>**Nakijin Castle Ruins**\- I was dumb and didn't make it to this one but this is a great one I’ve read. This is also a UNESCO World Heritage site so you can kill 2 birds with one stone. From what I have read, at night the paths lined with small glass lanterns. Guess what?\! Actually, they are used for the nighttime illumination. The scene you see at night sounds like a fairy tale\!

<br>**Nago Central Park**\- Nago is the opposite end of Mout Yaedake so you cant make both in one day. This is the most recommended place in Okinawa. The festival time is great to go with all the local food vendors. I suggest the Yakisoba of course\!&nbsp;

Now, these are just 3 places to see Cherry Blossoms but Oki has so many\! If you just drive outside of the city you can find them everywhere. Okinawa isn't just beaches, there are mountains and waterfalls and so much more to see\! Add it to your must-do list in Japan.&nbsp;<br>![](/uploads/cherry-blossom-4.jpg)![](/uploads/cherry-blossom-6.jpg)
