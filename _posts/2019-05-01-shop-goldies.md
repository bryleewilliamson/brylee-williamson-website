Moving to California scared me. Leaving Japan scared me. I had created such a small group of creators who loved to photograph together. When I came to Cali I was afraid I wouldn't find that. But I decided to reach out to this amazing Photographer Isaiah E. KajumbaI. I saw his work and was absolutely amazed by his style of photography.\!&nbsp;

After a few weeks of getting settled, he reached out to me and asked If I wanted to shoot with him and this local store in Downtown Ventura.. Goldies. OF COURSE, I DID\!&nbsp;

I hadnâ€™t modeled in over a month\! I was so excited and nervous but I did it. Take a look at some highlights.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or need some advice on what to buy, hit me up\!&nbsp;
