You’ve seen The Beach right? That epic movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and the group of Travelers who live in Paradise? That movie is insane but that’s not the point. The point is, from that movie came the tourist destination in Thailand known as Maya Bay.&nbsp;

Maya bay is one of the most beautiful destinations in Thailand. The beach is enclosed by three 100 meter cliffs on each side. (no you don’t have to swim to get there). The area has silky white sand, colorful corals, and exceptionally clear aqua water.

At least that’s what you read when you google “Maya Bay.”

In reality, the place is not as beautiful as described or as serene as the movie.

This is all do to Tourism in Maya Bay. The tourist boom in the area has damaged the natural ecosystem of the area. Corals have been damaged by the insane amount of boats coming in and out of the area. The white sandy beaches have been littered by garbage tourists leave behind. And the clear aqua water is littered with long boats and speed carrying hoards of tourists.&nbsp;

On any given day, thousands of tourists come to Maya Bay. Therefore to get your famous “instagram worthy shot” you better be good at photoshopping. Or be an early riser who can get there before the crowds or after 5pm. But the problem is not many boats will go early or late so expect to be surrounded by loud music, loud people, no serenity or quiet.

But don’t get me wrong. The place is still worth a beautiful trip. When you go though, be delicate to the surrounding area and leave it as you found it. That means, TAKE YOUR TRASH.&nbsp;

If you want to experience the full serenity and everything Maya Bay has to offer. I suggest doing Maya Bay Sleep Aboard. This once in a lifetime experience allows you to see the Bay without any footprints in the sand, no boats blocking your view, and hear the sound of the ocean, not over powered by the noise of people.&nbsp;

Through this tour, you get to actually sleep on a boat under the stars in the Bay. How cool is that?\! At night you get to swim with the bioluminescent plankton. Something not many people can say they’ve done.&nbsp;

\*\* At the time of this article, Maya Bay is closed indefinitely to correct and restore the natural ecosystem. \*\*&nbsp;
