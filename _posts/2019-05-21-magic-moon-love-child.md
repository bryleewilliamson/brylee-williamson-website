Vintage\! I’m a total vintage girl. Seriously, flare jeans, weird tops, denim jackets. I see it, I want it. Sadly I ain't got the budget for it\! My friend Natalie owns a [depop ](https://www.depop.com/magicmoonlovechild/){: target="_blank"}shop where she shops for vintage clothes and sells them. I don’t know about you but the joy of trying to find&nbsp; vintage clothing is epic. Check out my girls [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/magicmoonlovechild/ ){: target="_blank"} and her shop for more looks\!

We wanted something urban to show both a sweet side and and an edgy side. Nothing better than a downtown area of Ventura\! [Isaiah](https://www.instagram.com/isaiahxaiah/){: target="_blank"} knows the best places to shoot at\!&nbsp;

We also were lucky to have [Katelynn ](https://www.instagram.com/katelynn_jean_artistry/ ){: target="_blank"}she is a miracle worker with this face\!

I hope you like the looks we created together.

Natalie’s whole goal is to bring outfits together to show a persons personality. She is a stylist and can read people from the moment she meets them.
